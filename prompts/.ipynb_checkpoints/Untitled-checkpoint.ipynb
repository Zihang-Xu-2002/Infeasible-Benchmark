Prior to his presidency, Trump built a career in real estate development and entertainment, most notably as the host of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" His presidency was characterized by its unconventional approach to policy and governance, significant tax cuts, efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and a strong focus on immigration enforcement and border security. Trump is the first U.S. president without prior government or military service and was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, in 2019 and 2021, but was acquitted by the Senate on both occasions. After leaving office, he continued to exert considerable influence over the Republican Party.'\n",
